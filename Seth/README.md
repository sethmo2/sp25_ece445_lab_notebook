## February 6, 2025 - Idea Finalization <a name="entry0"></a>
After individually brainstorming, we met up as a group to pool our ideas and narrow down our options in order to complete an RFA (request for approval) for our project. We decided on a micro-controller based project that would double as a backpack item tracker to prevent losing or leaving behind the contents of one's backpack and act as an anti-theft device.

## February 13, 2025 - Product Expansion <a name="entry1"></a>
Today's focus was on the completion of a full project proposal document. We decided to go with the name "Backtracker" while also solidifying the subsystems we would be implementing: accurate RFID based item tracking, gyroscope based anti-theft measures, and an auto-zip and auto-locking mechanism. \

## February 16, 2025 - Design Review Preparation <a name="entry2"></a>
We finished out some details on our design in order to present it to the TA and professor for feedback. We have narrowed down our choice of micro-controller to an ESP32 or STM32 and will need to do further analysis. We have also found potential parts for the RFID antenna: ARRUN5-915.000MHZ and MFRC52202HN1,151, of which again further analysis will be needed.
